          Dutton Financial Services and its representatives will only seek to
          collect necessary information from you in order to provide you with
          the credit assistance you have sought from us. We may also use this
          information for purposes associated with our services such as
          follow-up calls to assist you.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>2. Types of Information We May Access</h2>
        <p>
          Dutton Financial Services and its representatives will generally seek
          "personal information" and "financial information" about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Personal information</strong> is any information from which
          your identity is reasonably apparent, which may include information or
          an opinion about you, your name, date of birth, address, account
          details, occupation, and any other information which we may require to
          identify you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Financial information</strong> is that which we utilise to
          assess your suitability for a credit product or to assist you in
          applying for a credit product. Examples include any finance you may
          have outstanding, your repayment history in respect of these loans, as
          well as details of your employment, income, and expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In certain circumstances, we may also be required to collect{" "}
          <strong>sensitive information</strong> (such as health information) on
          behalf of the lender in the course of giving you credit assistance.

        <h2>3. Services Without Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          Generally, it will be necessary for us to identify you in order to
          assist you with finding a product that meets your needs. However,
          where it is lawful and practicable for us to do so, we will allow you
          to conduct business with us to the full extent possible without
          providing us with your personal information, such as making general
          enquiries about promotional offers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing your information to us, we take this as confirmation that
          you consent to your information being used in accordance with our
          privacy policy.
